### Type I Superconductors

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}


- Exhibit perfect diamagnetism below $T_c$ (Meissner effect)
- Expels all magnetic fields ($H= 0$) due to Cooper pairing
- Critical magnetic field $H_c$ exists, beyond which superconductivity is destroyed
- E.g., Aluminum (Al), Lead (Pb)

### Type II Superconductors

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

- Exhibit two critical magnetic fields ($H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$)
- Allow magnetic vortices to form between $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ (mixed state)
- Usually compound or alloy materials with complex structures.
    - Exception are Niobium and Vanadium elemental solids.
- Often high-$T_c$ materials, enabling applications near room temperature
- E.g., Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO), Niobium Titanium (NbTi)
