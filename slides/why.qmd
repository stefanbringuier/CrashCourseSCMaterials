## Whats all the fuss

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Why did anyone care to begin with?
    - They didn't. Initially Heike Kamerlingh Onnes @OnnesReview2010 and others were just interested in cryogenics.
    - Once they achieved liquid Helium, they asked why note study conductive metals at these temperatures.
    - In 1911 Kamerlingh Onnes started with elemental Mercury, ðŸ’¥ the field of superconductivity (SC) was born.
- Physcist focused on measurement of other elemental solides and a theory.
- Observation of SC in Nb is really what begun technological use.

### Magnetic Resonance Imaging

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
- Superconducting coils allow for high magnetic fields.
    - **Stronger Magnets**: Enhanced image quality and resolution.
    - **Energy Efficiency**: Lower operational costs due to zero resistance.
    - **Cooling Required**: Increased cost.

### MagLev Trains
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
- Superconducting materials enable high-speed rail.
    - **Efficient Levitation**: Frictionless, high-speed travel.
    - **High Current Capacity**: Ideal for powerful electromagnets in propulsion.
    - **Downside**: Cryogenic systems maintain superconducting state.

### Energy Storage/Production
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
- **High Field Strength**: Enables stronger magnetic confinement in fusion.
- **Zero Resistance**: Increases efficiency in energy storage systems.
- **Cooling Trade-off**: Cryogenic needs offset by gains in efficiency.

## Most common complaints

- **Cooling Costs**: Cryogenic systems are energy-intensive and expensive.
- **Material Fragility**: Mechanical stresses can degrade superconducting properties.
- **High Costs**: Fabrication and maintenance of superconducting materials are costly.
- **Limited Current Capacity**: Some materials can't sustain high current densities.
- **Material Complexity**: Difficulties in integration with existing technologies.

Many advances have been achieved in last 30 years or so to address these concerns.

At this point I won't discuss why these are addressible with advances in refrigeration and processing techonology, but this is how I would approach it ðŸ˜„. Will touch on this at the very end.

Many others seek room-temperature (RT) superconductors. These many exist but who knows if they would have other suitable properties or current processing approaches would work.
