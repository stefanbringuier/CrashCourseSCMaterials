  abstractNote={Superconductors capture the imagination with seemingly magical properties that allow them to carry electricity without losing any energy at all. They are however, extraordinarily difficult materials to work with. In this book, Susannah Speller explores the astonishing variety of superconducting materials and the rich science behind optimising their performance for use in different applications. Readers will discover how diverse superconducting materials and their applications are, from the metallic alloys used in the Large Hadron Collider to the thin film superconductors that will be crucial for quantum computers. This book tells about how even the simplest superconductors have to be carefully designed and engineered on the nanometre scale. Along the way, the reader will be introduced to what materials science is all about and why advanced materials have such widespread importance for technological progress. With ?Wider View? and ?Under the Lens? sections, Speller provides an accessible and illuminating exploration of superconductors and their place in the modern world.},

    abstract = "{In a triumphant report to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), Kamerlingh Onnes documented his achievement in great detail. Therefore it is remarkable that reliable details about his serendipitous discovery of superconductivity three years later have been hard to come by. Lack of information has led to speculations about the discovery. In particular, it has perpetuated an apocryphal tale about the role played by a sleepy young apprentice in Kamerlingh Onnes?s lab. That tale was treated as established fact in a September 1996 Physics Today article by Jacobus de Nobel (page 40). There have even been rumors of the possible disappearance of Kamerlingh Onnes?s laboratory notebooks.}",
