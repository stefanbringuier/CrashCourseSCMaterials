## Basic Theory

- As we saw in @fig-HgSC_HKO, there are materials where electrical conductivity drops to "exactly"^[Here I use exactly in that it is zero within measurement precision. If your device can only measure to $10^-10$ then you show a resistivity value on that order.] zero.
- How is this achieved?
    - Well at low-temperature we have Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) to thank @Bardeen1957.

- What mechanism did they describe?
    - Cooper Pairs! 
    - Why Pairs? Blame the phonons.
