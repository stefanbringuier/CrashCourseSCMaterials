## Whats all the fuss

- Why did anyone care to begin with?
    - They didn't. Initially Heike Kamerlingh Onnes @OnnesReview2010 and others were just interested in cryogenics.
    - Once they achieved liquid Helium, they asked why note study conductive metals at these temperatures.
    - In 1911 Kamerlingh Onnes started with elemental Mercury, ðŸ’¥ the field of superconductivity (SC) was born.
- Physcist focused on measurement of other elemental solides and a theory.
- Observation of SC in Nb is really what begun technological use.
