  abstract = {{In a triumphant report to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), Kamerlingh Onnes documented his achievement in great detail. Therefore it is remarkable that reliable details about his serendipitous discovery of superconductivity three years later have been hard to come by. Lack of information has led to speculations about the discovery. In particular, it has perpetuated an apocryphal tale about the role played by a sleepy young apprentice in Kamerlingh Onnes?s lab. That tale was treated as established fact in a September 1996 Physics Today article by Jacobus de Nobel (page 40). There have even been rumors of the possible disappearance of Kamerlingh Onnes?s laboratory notebooks.}},

  abstractnote = {Superconductors capture the imagination with seemingly magical properties that allow them to carry electricity without losing any energy at all. They are however, extraordinarily difficult materials to work with. In this book, Susannah Speller explores the astonishing variety of superconducting materials and the rich science behind optimising their performance for use in different applications. Readers will discover how diverse superconducting materials and their applications are, from the metallic alloys used in the Large Hadron Collider to the thin film superconductors that will be crucial for quantum computers. This book tells about how even the simplest superconductors have to be carefully designed and engineered on the nanometre scale. Along the way, the reader will be introduced to what materials science is all about and why advanced materials have such widespread importance for technological progress. With ?Wider View? and ?Under the Lens? sections, Speller provides an accessible and illuminating exploration of superconductors and their place in the modern world.},

  abstract = {Overcoming cost barriers could make high-temperature superconductors pervasive Superconductors conduct electricity with essentially zero resistance, avoiding many of the power losses in present electric power transmission, conversion, and use. Strong electromagnetic fields have so far been the principal application of superconductors, with widespread commercial superconductivity limited to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) electromagnets composed of the low-temperature superconductor (LTS) Nb47Ti. Broader applications of LTSs have been hindered by the need to cool them with liquid helium (at or below 4.2 K). High-temperature superconductors (HTSs) (1) that can operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures (between 65 and 80 K) promised ubiquitous applications that could escape the constraint of LTSs. Achieving the International Energy Agency roadmap to carbon-free economies by 2050 would be greatly facilitated by the use of nuclear fusion-generated electricity. HTSs have been used in prototype nuclear fusion reactors (2), thereby creating the opportunity to overcome the cost barriers that have so far prevented the commercial development of HTS technologies.}
